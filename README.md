# Sequence Analysis Tool

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing protein sequences from a FASTA file. It performs various sequence statistics and generates a tab-separated values (TSV) output file with the sequence information.

## Usage

1. Install Python (version 3.6 or above) if not already installed.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Place your input FASTA file in the repository directory.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository directory.
5. Run the script using the following command:

   ```shell
   python sequence_analysis.py

6. The script will generate an output TSV file named output.tsv with the analyzed sequence information.
7. You can modify the script parameters and alignment settings as needed for your specific analysis by editing the sequence_analysis.py file.

## Dependencies
The script requires the following Python libraries:

Biopython(https://biopython.org/)

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
